```

## üíª Usage

### Interactive Console Mode

```bash
# Start the interactive console
h3xrecon console

# The console provides:
# - Command completion
# - Active program tracking
# - Rich asset display
# - Paginated results
```

### Command Line Interface

#### Program Management
```bash
# Set active program
h3xrecon use <program>

# Program operations
h3xrecon program list
h3xrecon program add <name>
h3xrecon program del <name>
h3xrecon program import <file>

# Program configuration
h3xrecon config add cidr <cidr>
h3xrecon config add scope <scope>
h3xrecon config del cidr <cidr>
h3xrecon config del scope <scope>
h3xrecon config list cidr
h3xrecon config list scope
h3xrecon config database drop
```

#### Asset Management
```bash
# Add assets
h3xrecon add domain <domain> [--stdin]
h3xrecon add ip <ip> [--stdin]
h3xrecon add url <url> [--stdin]

# Delete assets
h3xrecon del domain <domain>
h3xrecon del ip <ip>
h3xrecon del url <url>

# List assets (simple view)
h3xrecon list domains [--resolved] [--unresolved]
h3xrecon list ips [--resolved] [--unresolved]
h3xrecon list urls
h3xrecon list services
h3xrecon list nuclei [--severity <sev>]
h3xrecon list certificates

# Show assets (detailed table view)
h3xrecon show domains [--resolved] [--unresolved]
h3xrecon show ips [--resolved] [--unresolved]
h3xrecon show urls
h3xrecon show services
h3xrecon show nuclei [--severity <sev>]
h3xrecon show certificates
```

#### System Management
```bash
# Queue management
h3xrecon system queue show (worker|job|data)     # Display queue information for function execution (worker), function output (job), or recon data streams
h3xrecon system queue messages (worker|job|data)  # Show pending messages in the specified queue stream
h3xrecon system queue flush (worker|job|data)     # Clear all messages from the specified queue stream

# Cache management
h3xrecon system cache flush                      # Clear all cached function execution timestamps and results
h3xrecon system cache show                       # Display last execution timestamps for all functions and their cached results

# Status management
h3xrecon system status flush (all|worker|jobprocessor|dataprocessor)  # Clear component status information
```

The system provides three main management interfaces:

1. **Queue Management**
   - `worker` queue: Handles function execution requests
   - `job` queue: Contains function execution outputs
   - `data` queue: Stores reconnaissance data for processing

2. **Cache Management**
   - Tracks function execution history
   - Stores last execution timestamps for rate limiting
   - Maintains temporary results for performance optimization
   - Helps prevent duplicate function executions

3. **Status Management**
   - Monitors health and state of system components
   - Tracks component availability and workload
   - Manages component pause/unpause states
   - Helps in system diagnostics and troubleshooting

#### Worker Management
```bash
# Component operations
h3xrecon worker list (worker|jobprocessor|dataprocessor|all)     # List active components of specified type
h3xrecon worker status (worker|jobprocessor|dataprocessor|componentid|all)  # Show detailed status of components
h3xrecon worker killjob (componentid|all)                        # Stop currently running jobs on specified components
h3xrecon worker ping <componentid>                               # Check if a specific component is responsive
h3xrecon worker pause (worker|jobprocessor|dataprocessor|componentid|all)   # Temporarily stop component from processing new tasks
h3xrecon worker unpause (worker|jobprocessor|dataprocessor|componentid|all) # Resume component operations
h3xrecon worker report <componentid>                             # Get detailed performance and status report from component
```

The worker management system controls three types of components:

1. **Workers**
   - Execute reconnaissance functions
   - Process function execution requests
   - Handle rate limiting and job queuing
   - Report execution results

2. **Job Processors**
   - Parse function outputs
   - Validate and transform data
   - Generate asset information
   - Trigger dependent jobs

3. **Data Processors**
   - Handle data validation
   - Manage data storage
   - Process reconnaissance data
   - Trigger new reconnaissance jobs

Component Management Features:
- Real-time status monitoring
- Individual and bulk control operations
- Performance reporting and diagnostics
- Workload distribution management

#### Job Management
```bash
# Send jobs to workers
h3xrecon sendjob <function> <target> [params...] [--force]  # Execute a reconnaissance function on a target
```

Job execution provides the following features:

1. **Function Execution**
   - Run specific reconnaissance functions against targets
   - Pass additional parameters to customize function behavior
   - Force execution to bypass rate limiting with `--force`
   - Automatic job distribution across available workers

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevents excessive requests to the same target
   - Respects function-specific cooldown periods
   - Can be bypassed with `--force` flag when needed
   - Tracks execution history in cache

3. **Job Control**
   - Monitor job status through worker reports
   - Kill running jobs if needed
   - View job output in real-time
   - Track job dependencies and chains

Example Usage:
```bash
# Basic function execution
h3xrecon sendjob resolve_domain example.com

# Function with additional parameters
h3xrecon sendjob port_scan 192.168.1.1 --ports 80,443,8080

# Force immediate execution
h3xrecon sendjob resolve_domain example.com --force

# Complex function with multiple parameters
h3xrecon sendjob nuclei_scan https://example.com --severity high,critical --tags cve
```

    "database": "h3xrecon",
    "user": "h3xrecon",
    "password": "h3xrecon"
  },
  "nats": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 4222
  },
  "redis": {

  }
}
```
